	 	<h1> iMac Pro</h1>
	 	<h2> 18 cores in an iMac. No, that’s not a typo.</h2>
	 	<hr>
	 	<p>An iMac with 8 cores is remarkable enough. But an iMac with up to 18 cores is an entirely different creature. Add Turbo Boost speeds up to 4.5GHz, and iMac Pro has the power and flexibility to balance superb multicore processing with great single-thread performance. So whether you’re rendering files, editing 4K video, creating real-time audio effects, or compiling your next five-star app, it all gets done at lightning speed. Proof, once again, that there’s strength in numbers.</p>
	 	<p> Starting at 1999$</p>
