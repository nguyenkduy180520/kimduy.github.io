	<h2> Macbook Pro</h2>
	<h3> *TouchBar and TouchID*</h3>
	<p style="text-align: left;">The Touch Bar replaces the function keys that have long occupied the top of your keyboard with something much more versatile and capable.2 It changes automatically based on what you’re doing to show you relevant tools you already know how to use — system controls like volume and brightness, interactive ways to adjust or browse through content, intelligent typing features like emoji and predictive text, and more. And now Touch ID is available on a Mac, enabling instant access to logins and fast, secure online purchases with Apple Pay.</p>
	<br/>
	<h3>*Your favorite apps. Now with Touch Bar.*</h3>
	<p style="text-align: left;">The Touch Bar can change how you experience the apps you use every day — like Photoshop, Microsoft Office, DaVinci Resolve, Logic Pro X, and others. Key tools and features appear right on the Touch Bar, so they’re easier to discover and use. It’s a dynamic canvas that developers can use to add a new dimension of interactivity to current and future apps.</p><br/>
