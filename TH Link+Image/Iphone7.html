	 	<h2>iPhone 7</h2>
	 	<h3>Design</h3>
	 	<P style="text-align: left;">Apple’s next-generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus might look like last year’s model from afar, but there are a number of improvements to the design. For one, the antennas have been redesigned to make them look much less offensive. Also, the camera bump is now carved out of the same aluminum as the rest of the housing for a more seamless look and feel.</P>
	 	<br/>
	 	<h3>Power</h3>
	 	<p style="text-align: left;">Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be powered by a new A10 Fusion SoC.<br/>

		The A10 is a 64-bit quad-core chipset, including two high-performance cores that run 40% faster than the A9 chip, and two high-efficiency cores.<br/>

		There’s also a new six-core GPU that is 50% faster than the A9. It also consumes only two-thirds as much power as last year’s A9.<br/>

		Apple says the new A10 Fusion is the most powerful chip that has ever been in a smartphone.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center;"> Starting at 699$</p>
