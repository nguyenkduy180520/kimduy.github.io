		<h2>Ipad Pro</h2>
		<p>iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. The redesigned Retina display on iPad Pro sets a whole new standard. It’s not just brighter and less reflective, it’s far more responsive than anything that’s come before. Whether you’re scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game, everything feels utterly smooth, fast, and immersive.<br/>
		The new iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So movies and videos look spectacular, while games play smoothly without distracting artifacts. Fast, it turns out, is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive.</p>
